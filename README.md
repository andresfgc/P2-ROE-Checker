- __Features left to implement__

  - The user would be able to share more detailed information about the real estate he/she is evaluating (location, bank interest rates, images, etc.).

## Testing

For ideal responsive design a media query for a max-width-screen of 900px was included and tested across diferent browsers and devices.

## Bugs

On Apple mobile devices the background stays in a relative similar position while the autozoom shows bigger rent, credit payment and equity spaces. On Huawei mobile devices the background resizes itself a bit when clicking inside the form or scrolling down/up.
